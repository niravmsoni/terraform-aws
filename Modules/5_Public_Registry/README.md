# Terraform modules Public registry
- Hashicorp maintains a public registry [here](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules) helps us consume Terraform modules from others.
-  It includes support for module versioning and searchable and filterable list of available modules for quickly deploying common infrastructure configurations.
- Modules on the public Terraform Registry can be sourced using a registry source address of the form <NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>
