# Terraform State Locking
- Terraform uses persistent state data to keep track of the resources it manages. Since it needs the state in order to know which real-world infrastructure objects correspond to the resources in a configuration, everyone working with a given collection of infrastructure resources must be able to access the same state data.
- If supported, the state backend will "lock" to prevent concurrent modifications which could cause corruption.
- Example to test locking

- Task 1: Update Terraform Configuration
- Task 2: Issue a Terraform Apply
- Task 3: Specify a Terraform Lock Timeout
- Task 4: Explore State Backends that Support Locking

# Task 1: Update Terraform Configuration

Update the `main.tf` file and change the `tags` value of your `aws_instance.web_server_2` block

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web_server_2" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public_subnets["public_subnet_2"].id
  tags = {
    Name = "Web EC2 Server 2"
  }
}
```

# Task 2: Generate a Terraform State Lock

This task requires that you open two seperate terminal windows to your working directory.

In Terminal #1 generate a lock on your state file by issuing a `terraform apply`

`Terminal #1`

```shell
terraform apply

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value:
```

Do not provide any answer at this time.

In Terminal #2 within the same working directory, issue a `terraform apply`

`Terminal #2`

```shell
terraform apply

| Terraform acquires a state lock to protect the state from being written
| by multiple users at the same time. Please resolve the issue above and try
| again. For most commands, you can disable locking with the "-lock=false"
| flag, but this is not recommended.
```

# Task 3: Specify a Terraform Lock Timeout

In Terminal #2, re-run a `terraform apply` this time with `-lock-timeout` value

`Terminal #2`

```shell
terraform apply -lock-timeout=60s
Acquiring state lock. This may take a few moments...
```

`Terminal #1`
Answer `no` to the `terraform apply` command in the first terminal to free the state lock and observe be behavior in the second terminal.

# Task 4: Explore State Backends that Support Locking

Not all Terraform backends support locking - [Terraform's documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/index.html) identifies which backends support this functionality. Some common Terraform backends that support locking include:

- [Remote Backend (Terraform Enterprise, Terraform Cloud)](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/remote.html)
- [AWS S3 Backend (with DynamoDB)](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/s3.html)
- [Google Cloud Storage Backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/gcs.html)
- [Azure Storage Backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/azurerm.html)

Obviously locking is an important feature of a Terraform backend in which there are multiple people collaborating on a single state file.
